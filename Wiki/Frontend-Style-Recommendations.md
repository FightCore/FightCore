# What we're currently using
1. Website design base: Creative Tim's Material Dashboard Angula
    * [Live Preview](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-angular2/dashboard)
    * [Documentation](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-angular2/documentation/tutorial)
2. [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
3. [Ng-Bootstrap: Bootstrap Angular Widgets](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)

Essentially, we're using material design with Bootstrap. However, please use components from the above sites.

In addition, if there are similar controls in more than one site above, prefer to use whichever one comes first in that list. For example, if you wanted a Datepicker component, you could find one in both Angular Material and Ng-Bootstrap. However, you should prefer to use the one from Angular Material as that's #2 in the list while Ng-Bootstrap is #3 in the list.

# Other recommendations?
At the moment, no. Just make sure to use the Angular framework well and follow common good practices (eg, commenting, same style of tabs, etc).
