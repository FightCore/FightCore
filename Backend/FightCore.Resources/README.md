# Resource files

Resources files are files that contain pieces of text used in the application.
These can be used for translation or simple safekeeping.
Resources can be reused when needed, for example when using a message like `No CLASS with Id ID found`

This project should never have a dependency to anything and all projects can depend on this.

Please keep the folder structure intact, if you have changed to be made.
Contact the devs with a pull request before making these major changes.
