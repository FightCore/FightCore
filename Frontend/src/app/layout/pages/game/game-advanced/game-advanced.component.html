  Advanced players in this context are players who solidly understand the game and are 
  looking to step their game up with new options. This would be the space for unique 
  universal techniques that give you the ability to do things beyond the capabilities 
  of a normal player. Things like On Shield Option Selects, Slip Edge, Uturn slide, 
  platform Shield Drop, etc
