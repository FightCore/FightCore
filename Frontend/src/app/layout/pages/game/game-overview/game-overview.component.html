  Basic game info

  players, tournaments, streams, questions, etc) and links to those areas

  Other pages would be focused on different levels of mechanics to provide 
  a single go-to area to learn a game no matter your skill level. Current 
  plan is to have the ability to add enhanced "wiki articles" (including 
  ability to sign up for notifications and leave direct suggestions)
